Agent-friendly context and status commands for AI coding agents.

These commands provide structured information about worktrees that AI agents
can use to understand and manage git worktrees programmatically.

Examples:
  wt agent onboard       # Get compact workflow reference
  wt agent context       # Full worktree context with status
  wt agent status --json # Minimal status for polling
